# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

In the early weeks, my estimates were often overly optimistic. I frequently underestimated debugging time and integration complexity.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the weeks progressed, I started factoring in buffer time and reviewing similar past tasks, which significantly improved my accuracy.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to consider hidden costs like test writing, refactoring. Estimation is as much about risk anticipation as time guessing.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to see flaws in my code that I often overlook, such as inconsistent naming, logic repetition, or insufficient error handling. Feedback from others often helped me spot areas for refactoring and improve readability.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reading others' code critically, I became more aware of best practices and common mistakes. Reviewing forced me to justify what “good code” looks like, and that improved my ability to self-review as well.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac6](https://github.com/WhiteDarkTarot/cp1404practicals_TR2_2025/pull/4)

### Explanation

I reviewed a peer's implementation of a password checker and noted that the code was well-structured, followed good programming practices, and used documented functions. I highlighted the use of meaningful commit messages and modular design, reinforcing that their development process was solid and well-organized.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac5](https://github.com/Sithu223/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I confirmed that all tasks were completed correctly and complimented the author on the quality of the implementation. Even when no major changes were needed, my review still involved verifying structure, correctness, and adherence to task requirements — an important part of code review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would restructure the subject timeline to introduce testing and APIs earlier in the semester. This would allow students to apply these tools across more tasks and understand their practical value. Additionally, I would reduce time spent on Kivy and expand coverage of web development, which is more relevant for most real-world applications.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I maintained disciplined version control with clear, incremental commits. I consistently followed good coding practices such as SRP, function documentation, and modularity. I also engaged actively in peer code reviews, which reinforced my own understanding while helping others.
